The first issue occured on Ted's computer when he tried to merge the master with his branch after he'd already added some code. He should have pulled the most current version before making changes.

Bob and Carol created a new feature and ACP'd it but becuase by this time Ted had added his code, Bob and Carol had a merge conflict. Bob and Carol should have confirmed with Ted after he made his changes and pulled the most recent version and worked from that.

When Alice, Bob, Ted and Carol were all working on the master, Alice had a merge conflict because Ted and Carol pushed their changes first. Alice solved this conflict by pulling the master and comparing the new changes Ted and Carol had made to the changes she and Bob had made. Once she resolved the conflicts in VS code she was able to merge again to the master. Alice should have pulled the master code after Ted and Carol pushed their changes and added her changes from there.

We solved a lot of the conflicts by just deleting lines of code but in the future we wouldn't be able to this. We would need to keep track of more meaningful changes.
